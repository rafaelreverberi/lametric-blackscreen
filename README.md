# LaMetric BlackScreen

#### A minimal LaMetric app that turns your LaMetric Time into a completely black screen – no clock, no icons, no flicker.

This app is built for those who want to hide the display during the night, deep work sessions, meetings, or any other situation where you don’t want your LaMetric to glow.

## How it works

The app fetches a simple index.json
 file hosted on GitHub Pages (View live JSON
).

This JSON instructs the LaMetric to render a blank black frame.

A privacy.html
 page is also included (View live privacy page
), explaining that the app processes no data and respects your privacy.

Both files are part of this repository and are served via GitHub Pages.

## Features

- 🖤 100% black display — no ghosting, no text, no icons

- ⚡ Lightweight — loads instantly by fetching a single JSON file

- 🔒 Privacy-friendly — the app does not collect, store, or transmit any user data

- 🌍 Open-source — free to use, fork, and improve

## Installation

- Install BlackScreen directly from the LaMetric App Store.

## Privacy
The app comes with a privacy.html page (View live):
