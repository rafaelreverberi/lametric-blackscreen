# LaMetric BlackScreen

#### A minimal LaMetric app that turns your LaMetric Time into a completely black screen – no clock, no icons, no flicker.

This app is built for those who want to hide the display during the night, deep work sessions, meetings, or any other situation where you don’t want your LaMetric to glow.

---

## How it works

The app fetches a simple [`index.json`](./index.json) file hosted on GitHub Pages  
[View live JSON](https://rafaelreverberi.github.io/lametric-blackscreen-json/index.json)

This JSON instructs the LaMetric to render a blank black frame.

A [`privacy.html`](./privacy.html) page is also included  
[View live privacy page](https://rafaelreverberi.github.io/lametric-blackscreen-json/privacy.html)

Both files are part of this repository and are served via GitHub Pages.
